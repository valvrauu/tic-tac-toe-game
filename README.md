## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- **Bonus 1**: Save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- **Bonus 2**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - Routing library for React
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

Will be updated throughout the project as key lessons are learned.

### Continued development

I plan to focus on the following areas:

- React Advanced Concepts: Dive deeper into advanced topics like hooks, context, and state management libraries.
- Tailwind CSS: Build complex layouts and create customized designs for greater flexibility.
- Enhancing AI: Improve the game’s AI to make it more intelligent, adaptive, and responsive to player actions.
